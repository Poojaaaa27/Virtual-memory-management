# Virtual-memory-management
Virtual Memory management for operating system 
This project is a C-based simulation of virtual memory management in an operating system, focusing on concepts such as demand paging, page replacement algorithms, and page table creation. The program models how an operating system manages memory by loading pages into memory only when needed (demand paging) and uses various page replacement strategies to optimize memory usage. The project includes implementations of different page replacement algorithms, such as FIFO, LRU, and Optimal, and demonstrates how page tables are created and managed. To use the simulation, compile the source code and run the executable to observe how virtual memory is handled in an OS environment. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the intricacies of memory management in operating systems
